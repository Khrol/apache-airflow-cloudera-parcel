.SH NAME
diameter_dict \- Dictionary inteface of the diameter application.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
A diameter service as configured with \fBdiameter:start_service/2\fR\& specifies one or more supported Diameter applications\&. Each Diameter application specifies a dictionary module that knows how to encode and decode its messages and AVP\&'s\&. The dictionary module is in turn generated from a file that defines these messages and AVP\&'s\&. The format of such a file is defined in \fBFILE FORMAT\fR\& below\&. Users add support for their specific applications by creating dictionary files, compiling them to Erlang modules using \fBdiameterc\fR\& and configuring the resulting dictionaries modules on a service\&.
.LP
The codec generation also results in a hrl file that defines records for the messages and grouped AVP\&'s defined for the application, these records being what a user of the diameter application sends and receives\&. (Modulo other available formats as discussed in \fBdiameter_app(3)\fR\&\&.) These records and the underlying Erlang data types corresponding to Diameter data formats are discussed in \fBMESSAGE RECORDS\fR\& and \fBDATA TYPES\fR\& respectively\&. The generated hrl also contains defines for the possible values of AVPs of type Enumerated\&.
.LP
The diameter application includes three dictionary modules corresponding to applications defined in section 2\&.4 of RFC 3588: \fIdiameter_gen_base_rfc3588\fR\& for the Diameter Common Messages application with application identifier 0, \fIdiameter_gen_accounting\fR\& for the Diameter Base Accounting application with application identifier 3 and \fIdiameter_gen_relay\fR\&the Relay application with application identifier 0xFFFFFFFF\&. The Common Message and Relay applications are the only applications that diameter itself has any specific knowledge of\&. The Common Message application is used for messages that diameter itself handles: CER/CEA, DWR/DWA and DPR/DPA\&. The Relay application is given special treatment with regard to encode/decode since the messages and AVP\&'s it handles are not specifically defined\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"

.LP
A dictionary file consists of distinct sections\&. Each section starts with a line consisting of a tag followed by zero or more arguments\&. Each section ends at the the start of the next section or end of file\&. Tags consist of an ampersand character followed by a keyword and are separated from their arguments by whitespace\&. Whitespace within a section separates individual tokens but its quantity is insignificant\&.
.LP
The tags, their arguments and the contents of each corresponding section are as follows\&. Each section can occur at most once unless otherwise specified\&. The order in which sections are specified is unimportant\&.
.RS 2
.TP 2

\fI@id Number\fR\&:
Defines the integer Number as the Diameter Application Id of the application in question\&. Required if the dictionary defines \fI@messages\fR\&\&. The section has empty content\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The Application Id is set in the Diameter Header of outgoing messages of the application, and the value in the header of an incoming message is used to identify the relevant dictionary module\&.

.SH "MESSAGE RECORDS"

.LP
The hrl generated from a dictionary specification defines records for the messages and grouped AVPs defined in \fI@messages\fR\& and \fI@grouped\fR\& sections\&. For each message or grouped AVP definition, a record is defined whose name is the message or AVP name prefixed with any dictionary prefix defined with \fI@prefix\fR\& and whose fields are the names of the AVPs contained in the message or grouped AVP in the order specified in the definition in question\&. For example, the grouped AVP

                                     'AVP'}).

.fi
.LP
The values encoded in the fields of generated records depends on the type and number of times the AVP can occur\&. In particular, an AVP which is specified as occurring exactly once is encoded as a value of the AVP\&'s type while an AVP with any other specification is encoded as a list of values of the AVP\&'s type\&. The AVP\&'s type is as specified in the AVP definition, the RFC 3588 types being described below\&.
.SH "DATA TYPES"

.LP
The data formats defined in sections 4\&.2 ("Basic AVP Data Formats") and 4\&.3 ("Derived AVP Data Formats") of RFC 3588 are encoded as values of the types defined here\&. Values are passed to \fBdiameter:call/4\fR\& in a request record when sending a request, returned in a resulting answer record and passed to a \fBhandle_request\fR\& callback upon reception of an incoming request\&.

On encode, an OctetString() can be specified as an iolist(), excessively large floats (in absolute value) are equivalent to \fIinfinity\fR\& or \fI\&'-infinity\&'\fR\& and excessively large integers result in encode failure\&. The records for grouped AVPs are as discussed in the previous section\&.

An IPv4 tuple() has length 4 and contains values of type 0\&.\&.255\&. An IPv6 tuple() has length 8 and contains values of type 0\&.\&.65535\&. The tuple representation is used on decode\&.
